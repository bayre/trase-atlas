# Trase Atlas TopoJSON

This repository hosts TopoJSON files for each of the [Trase](https://trase.earth) focus countries. It is a direct fork of Mike Bostock's [U.S. Atlas](https://github.com/topojson/us-atlas) and it aims to follow the original implementation as closely as possible.

For each country there is both a projected and an unprojected file. The former is designed to fit a 975Ã—610 viewport.

To align the names of subnational jurisdictions in different countries, three levels have been set:  

* `level1`: country
* `level2`: region/state
* `level3`: municipality/district
